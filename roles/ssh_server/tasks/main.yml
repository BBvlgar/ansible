  # First of all if there is an admin defined within the `admins` variable and
  # it is not empty – this first check doesn't even check if `admins` is an
  # array or not, it only checks for sth. else than `FALSE`, `NONE`, `EMPTY` or
  # `UNDEFINED`.
  # The second condition checks – for each loop through the `admins` array – if
  # the defined username of the current admin (`item.name`) is not within the
  # relevant instance of `disallowed_users` array.
  # The `disallowed_users` array is defined with defaults within the `all.yml`
  # group_vars file, is fully emptied for the servers of the `alladmins`
  # inventory group within the `alladmins.yml` group_vars file and can be
  # overridden for each server in its corresponding host_vars file.
